# PromoteOneself
A plugin for Minecraft Spigot version 1.8. This plugin enables server administrators to set a series of targets for player to achieve in order to gain rewards, such as rank-ups (when a player meats a target, the plugin can be configured to run a set of commands). Targets are composed of aims; a player achieves a target upon completing all aims. Aims are achieved by, for example, gaining experience, gaining points, clicking certain configurable signs , etc. This plugin also has integration with the 'Valut' plugin and the 'PlayerPoints' plugin.
